 - The output voltage becomes very high if GND is not 
	connected/loose connection. This needs to be 
	prevented or considdered by the user.

 - Aurorica suggested some improvements regarding space 
	between the traces and drill sizes. We have to ask 
	him again...

Main board
____________________________________________________________
 - Move solder pads from under display
 - Relay RMC header not sufficient space
 - Arduino header to GND header, not sufficient space
 - More space for caps C1,C2/or smaller caps
 - Arduino USB not accessible
 - Flat resistor package too short
 - Why is there a jumper between 5V and AREF? Ok to remove?
 - GND of 3-pin header
 - Display upside down, change??? or keep??
 - screw holes too small
 - add support for mechanical relay (header on the main board)
